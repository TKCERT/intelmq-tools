# Features
* Integrates custom bots bots

# Requirements
- Installation of IntelMQ (see https://github.com/certtools/intelmq)
- Python3
- The custom bots need to be referenced in the python path

# Installation
Clone this repo somewhere on the system where intel mq is installed.

# Configuration
The tool needs a configuration file to find the base paths. There is a template in the config folder:
There are only two elements which needs configuration the table below will explain both:

|TAG|Description|
|---|---|
| intelMQLocation  | The location of intelmq. Example /lib/python3.6/site-packages/intelmq/bots  |
|  entryPointsLocation | Location of the entry_point file. Example /lib/python3.6/site-packages/intelmq-2.1.1-py3.6.egg-info/entry_points.txt  |

# Custom Bots
The custom bots, need to be stored in the "bots" folder in the same directory as the tool and the setup of the internal folders should follow the same structure as of the original one from intelmq.

The only difference is that the bots require a config.json, which defines the default configuration of the bot. The configuration is the same as in intelmq.

Feel free to check see the dummy bot in the given folder as example.
